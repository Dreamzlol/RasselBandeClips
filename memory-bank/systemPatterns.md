# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview

RasselBandeClips is built using SvelteKit, following a modern web application architecture pattern.

## Core Technical Decisions

### Framework Choice

- **SvelteKit**: Chosen for its performance, developer experience, and built-in features
- **TypeScript**: Used for type safety and better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for responsive and maintainable styling

### Design Patterns

#### Component Architecture

- Modular component design
- Reusable UI components
- Clear component hierarchy
- State management through Svelte stores

#### Routing

- SvelteKit file-based routing
- Dynamic route handling
- Clean URL structure

#### Data Flow

- Unidirectional data flow
- Props down, events up pattern
- Centralized state management when needed

## Component Relationships

### Core Components

1. Layout Components

   - Main layout structure

2. Feature Components

   - Clip display components
   - Streamer list components
   - Hall of Fame components

3. Shared Components
   - UI elements
   - Loading states
   - Error boundaries

## Technical Standards

### Code Organization

- Feature-based directory structure
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions
- Type definitions

### Performance Patterns

- Lazy loading where appropriate
- Image optimization
- Component code splitting
- Performance monitoring

### Testing Strategy

- Component testing
- Integration testing
- E2E testing with Playwright
