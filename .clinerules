## Project Intelligence

### Directory Structure

- `src/`: Main source code directory
- `static/`: Static assets
- `tests/`: Test files
- `memory-bank/`: Project documentation and context

### Development Patterns

- SvelteKit for application framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Component-based architecture
- File-based routing

### Workflow Patterns

- Documentation-first approach
- Memory Bank updates for significant changes
- Test-driven development when possible
- Regular progress tracking

### Code Style

- ESLint and Prettier for formatting
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Component documentation required
- Clear naming conventions

### Project Specific Rules

1. Memory Bank must be updated for significant changes
2. Documentation should be kept current
3. Component reusability is prioritized
4. Performance considerations in all features
5. Mobile-first responsive design

This file will evolve as new patterns and rules are discovered during development.
